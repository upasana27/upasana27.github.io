            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
            This work investigates a key limitation of reinforcement learning for 
            human–AI collaboration: agents trained via <strong>self-play</strong> often 
            struggle to cooperate effectively with humans. While self-play has enabled 
            major advances in multi-agent systems, it can produce coordination strategies 
            that are brittle and incompatible with real human behavior.
            </p>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>
            Self-play encourages agents to converge on conventions optimized for 
            their co-trained partners. However, these conventions may be arbitrary 
            and unintuitive to humans, leading to coordination breakdowns despite 
            high self-play performance. We examine why this generalization gap arises 
            and how it impacts human–robot teaming.
            </p>

            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>
            We analyze cooperative behavior in a collaborative task environment by 
            comparing agents trained purely via self-play against agents trained 
            with more diverse or human-inspired partner models. Through controlled 
            experiments, we study how conventions emerge, how stable they are, 
            and how well they transfer to interaction with previously unseen partners.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Contributions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Identified systematic failures of self-play agents when paired with non-self-play collaborators.</li>
                <li>Demonstrated how arbitrary coordination conventions emerge during co-training.</li>
                <li>Provided empirical evidence of the generalization gap between self-play and human collaboration.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>
            Our results show that strong self-play performance does not guarantee 
            effective cooperation with new partners. Agents frequently overfit 
            to partner-specific conventions, resulting in unstable or incompatible 
            coordination when paired with humans or previously unseen teammates. 
            These findings highlight the need for training paradigms that explicitly 
            account for partner diversity and human adaptability.
